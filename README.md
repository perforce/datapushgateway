# DataPushGateway


DataPushGateway is an advanced integration tool designed for managing and organizing supplementary data within Perforce server environments. It primarily functions by sorting and structuring data provided by external tools such as `command-runner` or `report_instance_data.sh`, which are integral to the [p4prometheus](https://github.com/perforce/p4prometheus) suite. This tool is key in organizing and presenting data in a coherent format, especially Markdown (MD) files, and stores them within a Perforce server, thereby aiding in tracking changes within the Helix Core server ecosystem.

The tool streamlines the process of consolidating server activities and configurations, making it a vital component for efficient data management in Perforce server ecosystems. Its integration with Helix Core versioning control software significantly enhances its capability to handle version-controlled data.

DataPushGateway is especially valuable for organizations that prioritize organized, well-documented server data, transforming raw supplementary data into structured documentation for easy access and comprehension by server administrators and auditors.

## Detailed Installation Instructions

#### Create a DataPushGateway Bot User:

1. Create a new user (e.g., `bot_HRA_instance_monitor`) on your Perforce server for DataPushGateway to use. This user will be responsible for submitting changes.
    This user should be part of a user group with the Timeout set to Unlimited
2. Ensure this user/group has the necessary permissions to create and submit changes to the depot.

#### Create a Perforce Client Workspace:

1. Set up a Perforce client workspace for the bot user. Hereâ€™s an example client specification:

    ```
    Client: bot_HRA_instance_monitor_ws
    Owner: bot_HRA_instance_monitor
    Root: /home/datapushgateway/data-dir
    Options: allwrite noclobber nocompress unlocked nomodtime rmdir noaltsync
    SubmitOptions: leaveunchanged
    LineEnd: local
    View:
        //datapushgateway/... //bot_HRA_instance_monitor_ws/...
    ```

2. Adjust the `Root` and `View` as per your server setup. The `Root` should match the directory where DataPushGateway will store its data.

Before starting the DataPushGateway, you need to set up the `config.yaml` file with the appropriate settings:

3. Set the `P4CONFIG` path in the `config.yaml` file. This path points to your `.p4config` file which contains necessary Perforce settings. Add the following line to `config.yaml`:

```
        P4CONFIG: /home/datapushgateway/.p4config
```

4. Edit `.p4config` file in the directory defined in the config.yaml

```
P4PORT=ssl:my_monitoring_server:1666
P4USER=bot_HRA_instance_monitor
P4CLIENT=bot_HRA_instance_monitor_ws
P4TICKETS=/home/datapushgateway/p4stuff/.p4tickets
P4TRUST=/home/datapushgateway/p4stuff/.p4trust
```

5. Ensure that other settings in `config.yaml` are correctly configured according to your environment and requirements.


The `auth.yaml` file needs to be configured with user credentials encrypted using bcrypt. This file is used for basic authentication when accessing DataPushGateway. Follow these steps to set up the `auth.yaml` file:


6. Generate a Bcrypt Encrypted Password:


   Use the `mkpasswd` binary located in the `tools` directory to create a bcrypt encrypted password. Run the following command in the terminal:


Follow the prompts to enter and confirm your password. The command will output a bcrypt encrypted password.


7. Configure `auth.yaml`:


Open the `auth.yaml` file and add your username and the bcrypt encrypted password in the following format:


```yaml
basic_auth_users:
  your_username: [bcrypt encrypted password]
```
8. **Start DataPushGateway with Authentication and Data Directory:**


   To start the DataPushGateway, use the following command, specifying the `auth.yaml` file and the data directory path:

```bash
./datapushgateway --auth.file=auth.yaml --data=/home/datapushgateway/data-dir
```


The `--debug` flag is optional and enables detailed logging.


   When you run DataPushGateway for the first time, the tool automatically manages the login process for the bot user (`bot_HRA_instance_monitor`). This includes handling passwords, tickets, and trusts as needed to ensure the user has valid credentials and permissions to submit changes to the depot.


   If the bot user's password is required during this process, DataPushGateway will prompt for it. This step is crucial for verifying that the bot user can access the depot and has the necessary permissions to submit changes.


   After this initial setup, DataPushGateway should operate autonomously, handling subsequent logins and permissions without manual intervention.



## Log Generation


```bash
./datapushgateway --auth.file=auth.yaml --data=/home/datapushgateway/data-dir > datapushgateway.log 2>&1 &
```


# DataPushGateway Files and Sorting Process via the JSON endpoint

## Overview of `sort.yaml` Structure

### File Configurations (`file_configs`)
Each entry under `file_configs` represents a Markdown file to be generated with specific components:
- `file_name`: Name of the Markdown file with `%INSTANCE%` as a dynamic placeholder.
- `directory`: Directory path for file storage, supporting `%INSTANCE%` placeholder.
- `monitor_tags`: List of tags for categorizing data into the respective file.

## File Categorization Process

### Dynamic Naming and Directory Paths
- `%INSTANCE%` placeholder allows for dynamic creation of file names and directories based on the Perforce server instance.

### Tag-Based Sorting
- Incoming data is processed and categorized based on `monitor_tags`.
- Each tag corresponds to a specific type of data or metric.

## Examples of File Configurations

### Instance-Specific Server Reports
- `file_name: HRA-%INSTANCE%` 
  - Comprehensive report for each instance including OS tests, disk alerts, server info, and Perforce configurations.
- `directory: servers`
  - Stored in the `servers` directory.

### Support Related Information
- `file_name: support`
  - Gathers data like disk alerts, server configurations for support.
- `directory: servers/%INSTANCE%`
  - Stored in a subdirectory named after the instance under `servers`.

### Detailed Configuration and System Information
- Separate files for triggers, extensions, properties, each with specific `monitor_tags`.
- Organized under `servers/%INSTANCE%/info`.

## Documentation Format
- Markdown files include relevant data categorized under respective `monitor_tags`.
- Structured format for quick reference and understanding of server configurations and status.

## DataPushGateway Handling via the `/data/` Endpoint

### Overview of `/data/` Endpoint Functionality
